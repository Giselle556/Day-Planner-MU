# Day-Planner-MU

With this day planner you will be able to keep track of your items throughout the day. It has visual aides to help keep you on track of your time as well as the date and time on top of the page. If you have green time blocks it means current time has already passed ex. it is 2pm so anything from 9am-1pm will be green. A gray block will sit on the current hour. And finally yellow blocks will sit on time slots on time that has yet to happen, ex. it is currently 2pm so 3pm-5pm will be yellow. Enjoy!!
